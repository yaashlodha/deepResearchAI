This project is an agentic system built using LangGraph, Tavily, and Ollama to automate research and response generation. It consists of multiple agents working together in a workflow:

  Research Agent → Uses Tavily API to fetch real-time information from the web.
  Answer Drafting Agent → Uses Ollama LLM (Mistral) to generate structured responses based on research results.
  LangGraph Workflow → Manages the agent interactions and data flow.
